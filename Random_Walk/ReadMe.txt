RANDOM WALK PROBLEM STATEMENT:


You are walking up the Empire State Building and playing a game with your friend.

For 100 times, you roll a dice:

If it is 1 or 2, you go one step down.
If it is 3, 4, or 5, you go one step up.
If it is 6, you roll the dice again, and walk the resulting number of steps up.
You can not go below step 0.
You have a 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs when you make a move - falling down means you have to start again from step 0.
And you bet your friend that you will reach 60 steps high. What is the chance that you will win this bet?
